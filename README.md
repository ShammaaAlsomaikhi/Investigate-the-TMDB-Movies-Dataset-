# Investigate-the-TMDB-Movies-Dataset-
data analyst nanodegree project 1: Investigate a Dataset  (tmdb-movies)

In this project, I am investigating a TMDb movies database file which has collection of important detials of about 10k+ movies, including their details of budget, revenue, release dates, etc.

Questions for Analysis:
Q1: Is there a correlation between a movie's popularity, budget, and revenue? Do highly popular movies tend to have larger budgets and better revenue?

Q2: Does the duration of movies increase over the years? Is there a correlation between the release year and the runtime of movies?
